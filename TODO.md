1. Opening a pdf, quitting and coming back creates a fake tab?
2. Sometimes I need to click with my mouse to be able to do keyboard input into a page
    >> Currently with fixed only happens when I don't select anything in caret mode
3. Default "All" selector accessed by pressing f to enter click hint mode doesn't highlight all elements that I'd like to click (click events, checkboxes, etc...)
4. Get rid of fatal crash screen I don't wanna report shit.
5. Fix "Cannot read properties of undefined reading (length)" when selecting a text input
6. Things that would normally keep me in command mode focus like failing a search no longer do due to my fixes to #2 which isn't good
7. AI sometimes doesn't fire
8. "Unknown error while getting elements" Is so fucking annoying when I press f
9. The fake click that is sent on hinting may not click on the desired item
10. Overhaul UIs like the crash report and the download so that they follow my terminal theme

# Improvements
1. Add fine-grained selectors. f should highlight all elements with click events, right click all with right click events, and hover all with hover events. + extras for all those
2. Add a way to click outside of images once you've focused them
3. Allow for website-scoped css aplication so I can go crazy with the neo-blue theme and start improving it per-website like darkreader.
4. zz centers selection on caret mode and highlight mode (/ and ?)
